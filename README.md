Hamstring Rehab Analysis Dashboard
A Streamlit-based sports science dashboard that visualizes recovery timelines for hamstring injuries. It uses Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to estimate the probability of Return to Training (RTT) and Return to Play (RTP) over time, allowing physios and coaches to benchmark rehab progress.

Features
Survival Analysis: Calculates and plots Kaplan-Meier curves for injury recovery.

Interactive Filtering: Filter data by Player Position (e.g., Midfielder, Forward) and Leg Dominance.

Dual Metrics: Toggle between Return to Training (RTT) and Return to Play (RTP) timelines.

Recovery Visualization: Inverted survival curves showing the "Cumulative % of Players Returned" over time.

Synthetic Data Generator: Includes a script to generate realistic, randomized dummy data for testing and demonstration.

🛠️ Prerequisites
You need Python 3.8+ installed. The project relies on the following libraries:

Streamlit: For the web interface.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation.

Lifelines: For the Kaplan-Meier statistical analysis.

Plotly: For interactive charts.

OpenPyXL: For reading/writing Excel files.

 Installation
Clone or Download this repository (or place your app2.py and create_data.py files in a dedicated folder).

Install dependencies using pip:

Bash

pip install streamlit pandas numpy lifelines plotly openpyxl
⚡ Quick Start
Follow these two steps to get the app running:

Step 1: Generate Data
Since the app requires a specific Excel structure, run the generator script first to create the sample data file (test_data_v2.xlsx).

Bash

python create_data.py
You should see a message: SUCCESS: Created 'test_data_v2.xlsx' ...

Step 2: Run the App
Launch the dashboard using Streamlit:

Bash

python -m streamlit run app2.py
Your default web browser will open automatically with the dashboard.

Project Structure
Plaintext

├── app2.py              # Main application logic (Streamlit dashboard)
├── create_data.py       # Script to generate synthetic test data
├── test_data_v2.xlsx    # The data file (generated by create_data.py)
└── README.md            # Project documentation
❓ Troubleshooting
1. FileNotFoundError: test_data_v2.xlsx

Cause: You haven't run the data generator yet, or you are running the command from the wrong folder.

Fix: Ensure you are in the correct directory in your terminal and run python create_data.py.

2. KeyError: 'Date_NA'

Cause: The app is reading an old or malformed version of the Excel file.

Fix: Run python create_data.py again to overwrite the file, then clear the Streamlit cache (Press C in the app -> Clear Cache).

3. ModuleNotFoundError

Cause: Missing libraries.

Fix: Run pip install streamlit pandas lifelines plotly openpyxl.

📊 How to Interpret the Graph
X-Axis (Days): The number of days passed since the injury occurred.

Y-Axis (% Returned): The percentage of players who have successfully returned to play/training by that day.

The Curve: A steeper curve indicates faster recovery times. A flat line indicates a period where no players returned.
